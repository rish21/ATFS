PROJECT TITLE

Developing Assistive Technology for Studying Maths and Science for the Visually Impaired and Blind

--

ABSTRACT

The WHO reports with confidence that there are currently over 2 billion people in the world who have some form of visual impairment or blindness. Over 30 million have severe impairment and over 1 million of those are children under the age of 15. The challenges faced by these individuals is unprecedented, simply navigating and understanding the space around them, is a large enough problem in itself. Those who have severe visual impairment or total blindness rely on solutions such as guide dogs, technology and their remaining biological senses to tackle many of these challenges. These solutions become particularly interesting when education is considered. 

Advances in hardware and software have paved the way for many solutions both simple and complex; from text enlargers to braille translation software and hardware. These solutions have their merits and drawbacks but they all share one common problem, they rely on the material they are making interpret-able, being digital. Studying paper based, non-digital material is a major challenge and one that this project aimed to tackle. It focuses on enabling impaired students to study and pursue their passion for science.

The developed system incorporated technologies that make use of Machine and Deep Learning tools, digital image processing and heuristic methods to capture the paper material being studied. It is capable of analysing text, images, graphs, equations and tables within the page and makes all of this information available via a user friendly audio and controller based UI. The evaluation of the system proved that for defined sets of material, the system functions admirably and does indeed enable an individual without vision to study science based material.
