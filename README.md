##### ABSTRACT

The WHO reports with confidence that there are currently over 2 billion people in the world who have some form of visual impairment or blindness. Over 30 million have severe impairment and over 1 million of those are children under the age of 15. These individuals face several unprecedented challenges, one these being education. Advances in hardware and software have paved the way for many solutions both simple and complex; from text enlargers to braille translation devices. However, these solutions are not adequate for students wishing to study more complex STEM subjects. Interpreting information with items such as graphs and tables is extremely difficult and this problem is heightened as much of the national curriculum still uses dated non-digital paper only material. This project tackled this problem by developing a system that incorporated computer vision and machine learning technologies, to enable students to study and pursue a passion for STEM subjects. It scans the literature before the student and extracts all the information present within it. Graphs, tables, images, equations and text are all converted into speech or audio that can be interpreted and understood by the student. They can navigate a virtual interface using a joystick controller to access all this information, study the material and answer questions. User testing proved that this system was effective at extracting and presenting information to the user, enabling them to study and answers questions from STEM subject material.

##### Setup and Run

This project was programmed using Python3.6.

The 'requirements.txt' file should list all Python dependencies, and they should be installed using:

```python
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Ensure you are in the 'src' directory and run:

```python
python main.py
```
